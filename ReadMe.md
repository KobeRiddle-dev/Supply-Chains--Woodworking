# Supply Chains: Wood Working

- Wood Logs must be cut into lumber for most uses. 
- 1 log -> 2 lumber
- Special structures and furniture built with logs are less beautiful and comfortable, but are sturdier with higher HP.

Production stations:
- Neolithic:
	- Crafting spot: slow, 1 at a time cutting
	- Wood Trestle: with the assistance of proper tools, wood can be cut faster and in small batches
- Medieval:
	- Mechanical Lumber Mill: mechanical power allows for wood to be cut much faster and in bigger batches
- Industrial:
	- Electric Trestle: a fast version of the Wood Trestle, consuming power
	- Electric Lumber Mill: a faster version of the Mechanical Lumber mill, consuming electrical power instead of mechanical power
